  "think-big": "Think big.  Thinking small is a self -fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that \ninspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.  \n \nAll of us have to be looking around corners, we cannot be content with where we are . Part of being a great \ninventor is being able to look around corners . And you have to constantly be asking what are the next big \nbreakthroughs for customers?  What is a customer problem that needs solving?  \n \nLook at techno logy and  the technology that's around the corner.  How is that going to  change the customer \nexperience?  What are other companies going to  do that  we know customers are going to  love where we're g oing \nto want to  be there first and we're going to  want to deli ver that for customers earlier ?  \n \nIf you want to  build a company that lasts over 100 years and that outlasts all of us.  You cannot run the same \nplaybook for decades at a time.  And what's interesting is even though that makes perfect sense to most people, i t \nstill tends to be hard for people to change, to pursue a different tack  than what they've been taking , to take risks.  \n \nAnd that's where leaders who are great at  the think big leadership principle are so important and so important to \nour company and so im portant in business.  And if you look at the goals that we have taken, if you look at things \nlike for years and years, the way people expect to get products from our ecommerce business was over many days . \nAnd taking that to a model of no more than two days . And then taking that to more often one day and then taking \nthat to the same  day. And eventually,  with drones and what we're doing with Prime Air, we should be able to take \nit into a couple of hours or less . That's very different.  \n \nOr if you think about inventing the next generation infrastructure technology capability with cloud computing and \nAWS . Or if you think about looking at the 400 to 500 million households in this world that do not have broadband \ncapabilities and giving them that connectivity, or if you think about building the world's most helpful personal \nassistant, or if you think about how we can reinvent the consumption of automotive products.  Or if you think \nabout what has been a hopeless area in this country for many years in health care and  trying to reinvent that \ncustomer experience . These are bold initiatives that are not simple to do and these types of initiatives require \nthinking big and it's  what you do if you want to serve customers better . And it  is part of what not only makes \nAmazon unique  but also gives us a unique impact in the world.  \n \n",
  "dive-deep": "Dive Deep . Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently , and are skeptical when \nmetrics and anecdotes differ . No task is beneath them.  \n \nYou could argue that there is a bit of tension between the strategic part of think big and the detail orientation of \ndive deep.  And oftentimes people will say, well, which do you want, you know, do you want the strategic part or \ndo you want the detail part?  And the answer,  of course,  is yes, we want both .  \n \nAmazon is unique from other co mpanies and that we expect our people to not only be strategic , but to be willing \nto roll up their sleeves and be great at getting into the details.  \n \nThere are so many people who can fill up loads of whiteboards around office rooms with great ideas, but wh o \ndon't know how to get the details of those ideas right . And the reality is that the details of any idea are what \nmatters most.  That's what people actually see , what customers actually see.  \n \nIt's part of by the way, why the narrative format that we write papers and communicate  in and working  backwards \ndocuments are so useful because it's \u2014you know, whereas in a PowerPoint, you can speak at a super high level and \nyou don't have to get into the details \u2014it is hard to fake the details in a narrative . And gettin g the details right \nreally matters.  Every product, every business that I have ever been a part of or seen in Amazon have been made or \nbroken by how great we were at getting the details right  for customers.  \n \nGood leaders find mechanisms to inspect and audit  the details and to understand anecdotes and the right teams \nunderstand that the leaders who are looking at what they're doing and working with them on the details , are doing \nso to help them be right a lot and achieve great results for customers.  \n \nAnd then  the other piece is that with anecdotes, there are oftentimes, especially at our size , where you have these \nbig metrics.  I'll take an example if you ever look at operational performance metrics, things like performance \nagainst service level agreements or e rror rates or latency . They 're measured across really large numbers and they \ncan look perfectly reasonable.  And then when you actually get into the details of it, you find , well, you hear this \nanecdote that this customer was unhappy about something or you have a friend who told you that this didn't work \nout for them or you get an email from a customer who says, why is this the case?  And when you actually follow \nthose anecdotes, you find that there actually is a problem that may not be showing up in the broader metric \nbecause we cover so many people, they don't register in the metric.  But at our scale, even a 1% impact or a half a \npercent impact , is millions of people.  So follow the anecdotes, inspect the details because it's where you often find \nthe real  issues that could impact  customers . \n \n \n",
  "have-backbone-disagree-and-commit": "Have backbone disagree and commit.  Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they \ndisagree , even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They \ndo not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.  \n \nAt Amazon , you are not just empowered to speak up  if you think we're doing something wrong for customers of \nthe business, you're expected to do so . Regardless of level .  \n \nI can tell you that I get a lot of emails all the time from everybody at the company, at every level about ideas they \nhave and I value the m and I appreciate them.  \n \n\u201cI told you so ,\u201d is an expression that's completely useless at Amazon because it's a failure one way or the other.  It's \neither I didn't speak up when I was supposed to speak up and have backbone or that I'm not fully committing to  \nthe decision that we made in disagreeing and committing.  \n \nWe have this concept that we've talked about a long time with the company about social cohesion . Social cohesion \nis this notion that people often will compromise with one another to get along.  \n \nAnd so, the canonical example is, you know, you look at a ceiling and one person says it's 10 ft and the other \nperson says, no, it's 14 ft and they say let's compromise, it's 12 ft.  Well, it's usually not 12 ft.  You know, there's \nusually some answer that's cl oser to the truth.  \n \nNow, most issues that we deal with every day are not as simple as what I just said . They 're much more \ncomplicated, much more nuanced.  But the point remains the idea for us is to be truth seeking.  \n \nWe're not trying to compromise with one  another to make each other feel better or to get along.  We are trying to \nget to truth for what matters to customers.  That's what we \u2019ve got to  make decisions based on.  \n \nAnd then after whatever debate we have on issues and some issues are so difficult that we debate it for across \nmany meetings and many weeks.  But once we make that decision, we have to, as a group,  disagree and commit \nand wholly commit to that decision.  Even if you were on the other side of what got decided to be pursued.  \n \nNow, this again seems fairly obvious, but it's sometimes difficult because we hire smart people and we hire people \nwho have a lot of mission passion.  And it's hard to let go of what you think matters most for customers.  But at a \ncertain point, businesses have to make deci sions.  Otherwise they can't move, they will be stagnant.  \n \nAnd once we make a decision, we have to all get on board because the areas that we're pursuing as businesses, \nthey have such large expanses with so many things to solve for customers with so many ca pable competitors that \nwe need to focus all our energy on growing the same way.  \n \nSo, have backbone , disagree  and c ommit is a very important leadership principle to be great at .  \n \n",
  "learn-and-be-curious": "Learn and Be Curious.  Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious \nabout new possibilities and act to explore them.  \n \nThis leadership principle is arguably the one that I have seen most differentiate the people I've worked with for a \nreally long time and where they have grown their career substantially versus those that have stayed stagnant.  \n \nAnd I would say that for some people at a certain point, and I can't tell you why \u2014I have my own thesis \u2014but, at a \ncertain point,  they find it too threatening or too difficult to keep learning.  \n \nAnd I will tell you that the second you think there's little left for you to learn is the sec ond that you are unwinding \nas an individual and as a learning professional . You have to be ravenous and hungry to find ways to learn.  \n \nAnd it's not easy to do, even though if you have the right mindset, it's quite simple to do.  You have to think about \nthe idea that you don't know everything and that there's a lot to learn  and even if you spent many months or years \nlearning a certain area,  that it may flip upside down very quickly . Instead of that feeling threatening and scary, you \nhave to think about that a s being part of the fun of what you do.  \n \nAnd by the way, our jobs and our lives would be so much more boring if we knew everything there was to know . \nAnd so what you have to do is you have to think about, you have to be honest at looking at a situation and  what \ncustomers care about and you have to be able to self-assess  and be self -aware.  What am I doing well?  And what's \nthe team doing well?  And what do we need to get better at?  And you have to think about what do you want to \nchange and then you actually ha ve to build a real plan to change.  \n \nThere are actually a lot of people I know that are terrific about speaking about how they're go ing to  learn  and what \nthey've learned and what they're going to  change, who are really lousy actually affecting the change.  You have to \nboth have a plan on how you're going to  change and then make that change.  \n \nBut that is the difference between often continuing to build great customer experiences and businesses and not \nand growing and not . Try to get better, even a little bit better every single day, every single week that you come \ninto work .  \n \n \n",
  "hire-and-develop-the-best": "Hire and develop the best. Leaders raise the performance bar with every hi re and promotion. They \nrecognize exceptional talent and willing ly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop \nleaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent \nmechanisms for development, like Career Choice.  \nSo, anybody who's been a part of building something  big, and  world class, and hard,  knows it's never the \nresult of an individual. It's always a great team, but teams consist of great people and by great , I mean, \nmany of the leadership principles we've just been talking about.  \nIt's people who are smart and people who are right a lot and people who are inventive and people who \nare strategic and think big . People who are able to get into the details and who are able to move quickly \nand have high ownership and,  you know, people that are able to be obsessed abou t what matters for \ncustomers.  That\u2019s what we mean by great people.  \nAnd those are the people we're trying to find and those are the people that deliver the best results for \ncustomers. It's part of the reason, by the way that when we do hiring loops, the in dividual interviewers \neach take a leadership principle. That's how we define great people.  \nAnd when you're in a hiring loop and you're in a hiring meeting, you have to ask yourself  and the team \nhas to keep asking,  is this person at the bar? Do they raise t he bar? And if the answer is no, you should \nnot hire . Even  if you have time pressure to hire people to get moving on a project, do not lower the bar.  \nThe thing that matters most for customers and what we get done for the business and frankly, for a lot \nof all of us who are inspired by the people we work with is to work with people we respect and admire . \nDo not lower the bar . Who  we hire is one of the most important decisions we make every day, every \nweek, e very year.  \nThe reality is that one half of the hi re and develop leadership principle is about hiring. The other is really \nabout developing people. And as a manager, you have to be organized and thoughtful about what a \nperson does well and what they need to grow.  \nOne of the interesting things that's happen ed over the last several years is that I think for a lot of \ncompanies and for a lot of people, it's been harder to give people more critical feedback. It's really much \nmore popular to tell people what they're great at and what their superpowers are.  \nAnd by  the way, that is really important to recognize. But if you have great people and you have people \nwho are truly hungry to learn and be curious and get better, they want to know they need to know what \ntheir growth areas are and leaders and managers have to be good at coaching.  \nIt's not a right for you to be a manager. You could be a really good individual contributor, but it doesn't \nmean that you should be a manager. It's a privilege to be a manager. And part of that privilege comes \nwith the responsibility f or thinking about and actively developing the people on your team and coaching \nthem.  \nAnd I can tell you that at least myself and I know many people would say the same thing. The  managers I \nworked for who had the biggest impact in my career were not necessa rily the ones that were the nicest \nto me. I like when people are nice to me, don't get me wrong. But what really made the difference were \nthose leaders who recognized what I was good at but really identified where I needed to grow, to get to \nwhere I wanted  to get and to realize my full potential.  \nAnd that's what we have to do as managers of people. We want to help people grow and learn and get \nto their full potential.  \n",
  "success-and-scale-bring-broad-responsibility": "Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility. We started in a garage, but we\u2019re not there anymore. We are big, \nwe impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary \neffects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We \nmust begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our \nemployees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every d ay knowing we can do even more \ntomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.  \n \nSo, I think of this leadership principle is largely being great community members in the narrow and broad \ncommunities i n which we reside.  And we have to keep asking ourselves constantly whether the communities in \nwhich we reside are better off because we're there.  And if they're not, then we need to take action about that.  \n \nAnd it's not just the jobs that we bring, we brin g a lot of jobs to a lot of communities, but it's also the other \ncontributions to the fabric of those communities . Things like affordable housing where we've invested over $1.8 \nbillion in affordable housing in the Puget Sound area or the Arlington, Virgini a area or the Nashville area .  \n \nOr helping with the unhoused challenges we have in a lot of our cities.  If you look in the Puget Sound area with our \npartnership with Mary's Place, I think we're the only corporation or company that I know that houses famili es in \nour corporate buildings.  We have over 200 family members housed overnight every night in our buildings and over \n1,000 family members a year.  \n \nIt's also helping with food security.  We've partnered with 35 different cities to serve over 10 million free  meals to \nover 80,000 families in need.  \n \nIt's helping with education. Our philanthropic educational efforts have impacted over 3.9 million people in 9 \ncountries in the past year.  \n \nAnd our Amazon Future Engineer program has committed $16 million in over 400  scholarships to students who \nwouldn't otherwise be able to go to college and pursue a career in technology .  \n \nOr how we use what we can uniquely do to help with world crises . If you think about natural disasters, we've \ndelivered over 23 million relief ite ms in 44 unique incidents in this past year.  \n \nThese are all things that we've done across the company to try and be better community partners.  Over 150,000 \nAmazonians in this last year have volunteered in efforts that we worked on together.  So, we've alway s had a lot of \nindividuals across the company who've given back to their communities .  \n \nAs a company , we waited for several years until we were profitable to be more involved in our communities.  But if \nyou look at the last number of years, we have really changed how we interact with communities, including being \nthe top company giver to the Puget  Sound area for the last couple of years .  \n \n",
  "customer-obsession": "Customer obsession. Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn \nand keep cu stomer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.  \nI'm intentionally starting with customer obsession bec ause frankly everything starts with the customer \nand works backwards from there at Amazon.  \nThat's the way we think about our business. And it's always been true. It's always been palpable in the \nwhole time that I've been here.  \nIt's part of what attracted  me to Amazon 26.5 years ago, which was, you could really feel that this was a \nculture and a company that not just talked about doing right by customers, but walk that walk. We're all \ncustomers of so many businesses and we all know what we're treated like and typically companies talk \nabout being customer focused, but rarely are. And I really think Amazon has always been. And you've \nseen it from the beginning up to now, all sorts of examples of that.  \nBut, you know, I remember the first full year I was at Am azon, one of the big debates that year was \nwhether or not we should have customer reviews on books detail pages. We were books only retailer at \nthat point. And the debate really was because publishers didn't want us to have customer reviews \nbecause some of  them might be negative. But the reality is if you're trying to help customers make the \nbest possible decision for themselves on whether they want a product or not, having honest customer \nreviews is incredibly helpful. So we decided to have those customer reviews.  \nYou can see that customer focus all the way up to today. Just look at what happened during the \npandemic where we had this very uncertain economy where every company in the world, including \nAmazon, was trying to save money however they could. Most technolog y companies looked at that \nenvironment and said, we're going to find a way to extract every last dollar from our customers in this \ntight economy. Amazon did the opposite. In our cloud computing business, in AWS, we proactively went \nto customers and tried t o figure out how we could cost optimize for them where they could save money. \nSo they could redeploy that money in the future on projects that actually could help their business and \nthey could live to fight another day in a difficult economy. That's pretty  different.  \nAnd you can see it in how we do our product development here at the company as well. We won't write \nlines of code until we do the working backwards documents. A press release to make sure that if we \nbuilt the product, we know that it's going t o matter for customers. And then a frequently asked \nquestions, document where we really try and vet ahead of time, all the things customers care about. \nWhat problem are we trying to solve? What will customers care most about? What would they be most \ndisapp ointed about if we launch with this set of features? What will they love most? All the things that \nmake it work for customers. That's what we're always trying to figure out.  \nNow, I have also seen over time, sometimes people get confused about how competit ors or economics \ncome into play when you think about the leadership principle of customer obsession. And people \nwonder, well, am I being customer obsessed if I'm thinking about sustainability and economics of what \nI'm doing?  \nAnd you know, of course, many  of us remember in the early 2000, the company Cosmo, which promised \none-hour delivery of videos to your house. They actually delivered a lot of ice cream in my house too, by \nthe way. I really enjoyed the service. But it was not economic, and the business lasted a year or two and \nthen it was gone. And you're not really doing right by customers over a long period of time, if you get \nthem excited about something that you can't sustain. So, of course, you have to think about economics \nwhen you're thinking abou t what you're building.  \nAnd, and then some people ask, well, am I being customer obsessed if I think about what competitors \nhave offered and try to address something competitors have put out that customers like? And the \nreality is that if you're trying to  build the best possible customer experience, you have to be aware of \nwhat competitors are doing. And if competitors build something that we have and by the way, we're \nvery inventive and we're very customer focused, but we're not going to build every singl e new feature \nthe customers love, there are going to be others that do so as well. And if a competitor builds something \nthat customers love, we should be aware of it and we should be inspired by it and think about how we \ncan improve our own customer experi ence with what we learn from what competitors have done.  \nSo we always are going to have to be aware of competitors and economics and building the best \ncustomer experience. But we're going to spend most of our waking hours focused on what we know \ncustomers  care most about. And the reality is that everybody at this company has not just the freedom \nbut really the expectation to look at what customers want and figure out how we can be better and \nbetter for them every day.  \n \n",
  "strive-to-be-earths-best-employer": "Strive to be Earth's Best Employer.  Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher \nperforming, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and \nmake it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they \nempowered? Are they ready for what\u2019s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees\u2019 \npersonal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.  \n \nSo, this is one of our newer t wo leader ship principles.  And it's really a leadership principle that's broad and could \nbe interpreted lots of different ways.  \n \nAnd indeed, sometimes people do interpret it lots of different ways . As a company, we can't decide to do to be all \nthings and to do all t hings for everybody at the company.  And so, there are times when employees will want us to \npursue a certain tack and if we don't do it, they say, well, if you're really earth's best employer, you would have \ndone that.  And of course, you can't do all of tho se things.  \n \nSo, I thought I would tell you what I think of as the best possible place to work for employees.  I think that working \nat a place whose mission is to make customers'  lives easier and better every day is very inspiring . Not just saying it, \nbut do ing it . Walking that walk .  \n \nThen a company that's willing to not only make  customers'  lives better and easier every day, but that is also able \nand willing to do it on a very large scale.  If you think about the number of customers that you impact . And then a \ncompany that's willing to invent  and to invest and to bet it's not as inspiring , at least to me, to work at a company \nthat's running the same playbook for many years at a time . Being willing to look at what customers care about and \ninvent on their behalf is pretty inspiring.  \n \nAnd then being able to commit to those investments for long periods of time . Not running away  the first time you \nsee any lack of traction or any problems . Really working through how to get to the right solution for customers and \nfor the business .  \n \nAnd then doing all that at a place where you have a group of people that's smart, passionate and motivated and \ntrying to work together as a team and has a passion  about the mission that, that we're pursuing together.  To me, \nthat's w hat constitutes a great place to work.  And Amazon is very unusual in being so compelling in all those \ndimensions.  \n \nNow are the re things that we can do better for employees to be a better place to work ? Unquestionably.  And \nthere's many of them . Ranging from  how we can make it even safer in our fulfillment network for our employees \nto how we can train and improve our managers so that they develop our teammates careers the right way to \ncontinue to have a more diverse and inclusive employee base and set of team mates.  \n \nThere's lots we can do to keep getting better.  We will not be bored any time soon.  But I think it's a pretty amazing \nplace to work.  But with ways that we're going to  keep getting better . \n \n",
  "earn-trust": "Earn Trust.  Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self -critical \neven when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe the ir or their team's body odor  smells \nof perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.  \n \nPeople  sometimes get this earned trust, leadership principle wrong and they sometimes confuse it with meaning \nbeing nice to one another or having social cohesion or not challe nging each other in meetings.  \u201cI won't challenge \nyou if you don't challenge me or this person, you know, isn't trustworthy because they challenge me in a group of \npeople .\u201d That's wrong.  That's not what we mean.  \n \nWhat we mean by earn trust is being honest, authentic, straightforward, listening intently , but challenging \nrespectfully if you disagree , and then delivering what you said you would.  \n \nSo, if you want to earn trust, if you say you've got something, deliver it . If you think we're, we're doing somethin g \nwrong for customers of the business, speak up . If you own something and it's not going well,  own it . Say it's not \ngoing well , be self -critical , and fix it.  If you think we're not as good as we're saying we are benchmark it, use data \nand show us that we'r e not as good . And vice versa , sometimes I've seen teams waste time by beating themselves \nup when they're actually better than they think . Use the data and show us.  \n \nI'll tell you a short story.  That's a personal story, a little bit embarrassing , but I'll share it that I think is illustrative.  \nBack in the early 2000 s, I was co -leading the marketing team , and  we were presenting our OP1 or operating plan to \nthe S -team.  And back then,  we were still using PowerPoint presentations , and  we had a slide deck, there was 220 \nslides.  If you can believe it, it was like a six -hour meeting.  And I was presenting the 1st 80 slides or something like \nthat.  And about 10 slides in Jeff interrupts me and he says , \u201call your numbers are wrong on this sli de.\u201d And I was \ntaken aback , and  I said, \u201cwhy do you say that? \u201d \n \nAnd within a few seconds of him starting to dissect these numbers, I realized that he was right and that all the \nnumbers on that page were wrong.  And I was,  of course, embarrassed and I said, \u201cyou're right.  Those numbers are \nwrong. \u201d And he said, \u201cwell, why should I believe anything else in this presentation if those are wrong ?\u201d And I said, \n\u201cwell, I hope you will because we have 210 more slides in this presentation. \u201d \n \nAnd, you know, it turned ou t that we didn't have any more errors like that in the rest of the presentation, we got \nthrough it.  And it was  a very good learning experience, but I got  done with that presentation and I wasn't resentful \nor mad at Jeff for pointing that out.   \n \nI learned a  very valuable lesson on what it means to dive deep and what it means to have ownership over the \ndetail in your presentations.  And I earn ed trust by owning it being vocally self -critical and actually getting better \nand improving it and providing a much bet ter presentation and account for what was truth  the next time I \npresented to a much broader group.  \n \n",
  "deliver-results": "Deliver results . Leaders focus on the key inputs for their businesses and deliver them with the right quality and \nin a timely fashion . Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.  \n \nI intentionally wanted to end with this leadership principle because you can get everything else that we've talked \nabout right . You can be customer obsessed, you can be right a lot, you can be inventive, you can be strategic and \nthink big, you can  dive deep, you can be speedy, you can have the right owners hip, you can hire the right teams.  \nAnd the reality is if you fail on delivering, none of it matters .  \n \nWhere the rubber meets the road for customers is what you actually deliver for them.  \n \nAnd there are two macro forms of delivery. There are outputs and th ere are inputs . Outputs are really high -level \nmetrics . The  ultimate output for a public company is your stock price . Other outputs are things like free cash flow \nor your revenue or your operating margin.  But it's very difficult to manage the outputs active ly. \n \nAnd I remember, earlier in my career I had a manager and I would sometimes go visit that manager and he had an \noffice, a small office  it was completely dark except for the light, the glow from his monitor.  And I would sometimes \ngo to visit him and I w ould walk by and I'd see him go , \u201cOh!\u201d And I'd say , \u201cwhat happened ?\u201d And he'd say, \u201cwell, I \nwas looking at daily sales and we just went from being up 0.5 of 1% year over year to being down 0.71% year over \nyear. \u201d And I always thought that was so odd.  I said , \u201cwell, can you actively affect that by looking at the monitor? \u201d \nAnd he said \u201cno, but it's really important. \u201d \n \nAnd of course, it's important because if you don't have the right outputs for the business, then you don't really \nhave a business . But you cannot really actively manage the outputs.  What drives the outputs are the inputs . Those \nare the actual initiatives that we're all pursuing to change the customer experience in the business.  \n \nAnd that's what , if you look at almost all our key accomplishmen ts that we focus on as teams and across the S-\nteam, they're almost exclusively inputs because that's what can make a difference.  \n \nI'll say one last thing about delivery that I often see people get wrong, which is there's so much work that goes into \ndeliver y. You have to define a product, you have a working backwards document, you make several versions of \nthat working backwards document.  You have to hire a team.  There are all sorts of changes along the way as you \nget into actually building the product  and implementing it . That when you get to delivery and you get to launch, \npeople take this deep breath and they kind of feel like they're done.  \n \nAnd the reality is that launch , or delivery,  is not the finish line.  It's the starting line.  It actually gets you to the \nstarting point where you have something that you can actually build and make something meaningful out of . Very \nfew of any things I've ever seen be successful at Amazon have launched with an initial launch and all of a sudden \nbecome big breakaway hits.  \n \nYou always have to launch, you have to see what customers react to.  You have to get feedback from customers \nand you have to iterate . And the very best companies and the very best teams are fast and organized about \nlaunching, but then they're constantly it erating.  \n \nThat's how you get, you get 7 , 8, 9 launches , where you're iterating quickly , and all of a sudden you wake up and \nyou realize I have something really meaningful that matters to customers.  That's what delivery looks like.  \n \n",
  "invent-and-simplify": "Invent and Simplify. Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways \nto simplify.  They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere and are not limited by \u201cnot invented \nhere.\u201d As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.  \n \nSo for a lot of companies who actually make it as a company , they get through the startup stage and make it as a \ncompany, they make it on the strength of a great innovative idea.  \n \nHowever, for a lot of those companies, it actually becomes really difficult to invent something else new and they \nspend lots of time just iterating in small ways on that original invention idea that made them as a business . And it's \nactually difficult to sustain being successful in a dynamic the world we live in and how fast technology changes  if \nyou're not constantly inventing and reinventing .  \n \nI think over the 29 years that we've started, Amazon thus far, we have been very vigilant and very strong at \ncontinuing to in vent and simplify across our business.  And in some cases, it's been whole cloth invention.  \n \nYou know, pioneering AWS  and cloud computing is a good example of that or pioneering a digital book reader or a \ndevice that does natural language understanding  and automatic speech recognition , like what we did with devices \nfor Alexa , is another example.  \n \nAnd in many other cases, what we've done instead of whole cloth invention , is just completely reinvented our \nexisting business and the customer experience associate d with it.  And a really good example of that is our \nmarketplace business.  So in the late nineties or so, what we noticed , being externally aware , was that customers \nwere really responding well to companies like Ebay and half.com that had a lot of third -party sellers who are \noffering really broad selection and a variety of price points to customers.  And we debated very animatedly inside \nthe company, whether we should have a marketplace offering . And the reasons that people were resistant to \ndoing  so at the t ime were in part because we had all these relationships that we had set up with distributors and \npublishers  and we didn't know whether they would be so keen on us allowing third party sellers in the marketplace \nor on our website.  And then we also just coul dn't really believe that anybody else, particularly third -party sellers , \nwould take care of customers as well as we did.  And so we really fought this and eventually we decided that we \nwere going to  build a marketplace offering . Because at the end of the day, having much broader selection for \ncustomers and lower prices was better for customers.  And we're always going to  shade on what we think \ncustomers want most.  \n \nThen we really struggled with the right implementation.  And what we started with was trying t o build an auctions \nwebsite like Ebay.  And that was a complete me too offering that failed miserably.  And then we said, OK, we'll take \nall our third -party seller selection and we'll put it in a separate area of our website that we called Z shops.  And \nthat' s where all the third -party selection will be.  But of course, that turned out to be a cul -de-sac in a place where \nnobody wanted to go to.  And it wasn't until we came up with a simplifying assumption that we will have all our \nthird -party selection on the sa me detail pages as our first party retail selection where all the traffic was . Which,  by \nthe way, in retrospect, seems blindingly obvious , but the time was a real a -ha for us until we made that simplifying \nassumption, we did not have a marketplace business . And once we did, we actually found the marketplace offering \nreally took off.  And that turned out to be a really good decision for customers because they got much broader \nselection and even lower prices . And for our business, because about 65% of the unit s we sell today are \nmarketplace items.  \n \nSo we have to constantly be pushing ourselves to invent and reinvent what's possible for customers.  \n \n",
  "bias-for-action": "Bias for action. Speed matters in business . Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive \nstudy.  We value calculat ed risk taking.  \n \nSpeed disproportionately matters in every business , at every stage of the business you're in, in every industry \nsegment that you're in, at every size of company that you're in , unless you have a monopoly.  And I don't know, \ncompanies that exist as monopolies anymore.  Speed really matters.   \n \nAnd there are so me companies who get to a stage where they just believe they can't be fast.  And I saw this a lot in \nmy last job when I was managing the AWS  business, I met with many enterprise CEO \u2019s who said, \u201clook, you don't \nunderstand we can't move fast anymore.  We have  security concerns, we have compliance concerns.  We've gotten \nreally big.  We have a culture that's slow .\u201d And the reality is that isn't true.  \n \nSpeed is not preordained, it is a leadership and a culture decision.  And if you want to  organize and prioritize a nd \nyou value speed, you can move quickly . Even if you historically haven't.  \n \nAnd so you have to think about decisions in a certain way . Most decisions that any organization takes can be \ncharacterized as either one -way door or two -way door decisions.  \n \nAnd t he thing to think about is imagine walking through a door . There  are certain doors you can walk through \nwhere if you walk in the room and you've made a mistake, you can walk right back through that door and no harm.  \nAnd those are two -way doors.  \n \nAnd then t here is a smaller number of decisions , where if you walk through that door, maybe you can walk back \nthrough the door, maybe you can't walk back through the door.  It would be very hard to walk back through that \ndoor.  And those are one -way door decisions.  \n \nThe overwhelming majority of decisions that we make all the time here at Amazon are two -way door decisions . \nAnd those decisions should be made at the team level and you should make them quickly.  You should be \nthoughtful about them.  I wouldn't make them in a  harebrained way, but you should make them quickly.  And if you \nget it wrong, walk back through that door .  \n \nOne-way door decisions, as I said, are going to  be a very small number of those and those you should take time to \nthink through carefully, but most are two -way door decisions.  \n \nThen you also have to have the right mindset and the right urgency about decisions.  Don't take weeks to get done \nwhat could be  done in days or hours . And by the way , that sounds super obvious.  And you would be surprised how \noften you find teams that take weeks to get things done that could be done in days or hours.  \n \nYou have to have this idea in your head that we live in a world of closing windows.  And we had this for the first \nmany number of years of Amazon,  and I think we still have it in lots of places, but where there's a closing window . \nThere's a land rush.  \n \nAnd if you think about the areas in which we are building businesses  and customer experiences, we are competing \nagainst the most well -funded, capable, talented companies who are all pursuing the same types of things that \nwe're going after . These are races.  \n \nAnd so you have to think of it like that, like we are pursuing clo sing windows types of opportunities . And you want \nto show up every day, every week , thinking about how  when I leave this week, will my customers be better off \nthan when I started the week?  \n \nNow , is there a tension between having the highest standards and h aving a bias for action?  Yes, there can be a \ntension. B ecause the reality is in moving fast, you can't launch a subpar customer experience . By the way, \nlaunching a subpar customer experience also breaks the customer obsession leadership principle.  And so, just like I \nsaid earlier, leadership principles inherently have tension in them because you actually want to be very proficient \nand fantastic for customers across a lot of dimensions.  And sometimes those dimensions will intersect and conflict.  \nAnd part of our job, part of the nuance of leadership principles,  is to figure out how to find the right balance \nbetween them.   \n \nBut you can be fast while still having high standards.  I've seen it for 29 years at the company.  \n \nSo we need to think of ourselves , and this is the way I think about the company , as being the world's biggest start \nup. And that's the way we need to behave.  That's the way we need to act.  And we need to keep asking ourselves \nwhy can't we move faster for customers?  \n \n",
  "insist-on-the-highest-standards": "Insist on the highest standards.  Leaders have relentlessly high standards \u2014 many people may think these \nstandards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high \nquality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that \nproblems are fixed so they stay fixed.  \n \nCustomers have very high expectations of us , and they should.  And by the way, it's where we set the bar . And in \nthis day and age , it's ess ential.  It's so easy in this day and age for customers to switch or change . The internet \nmakes that super simple and gives customers very good information . And it means that you can't rest on what \nyou've done for the last 10 years, the last 20 years . \n \nHistorically, we have had very high standards, perhaps unreasonably high, but it's the right level for what we're \ntrying to accomplish.  \n \nAnd in my opinion, having high standards is one of the most critical under underpinnings for teams I've constantly \nseen in Amazon . I've seen it in Amazon , I've seen it with friends, I've seen it with  all sorts of kids and organizations  I \nwork with . Higher expectations lead to better results.   \n \nAnd as leaders here and as individual contributors here, as the business grows and a s the scope of what you all \nwork on grows, you can't be in every meeting.  And that means if you're able to, in the meetings you're in, set the \nexpectations, set the standards  high . Model  what good looks like . It's highly leveraged . Because it means that in  \nthe meetings that you can't be in , all the people who see you model it in the other meetings you're in can take that \nto those meetings and can spread it to the rest of the organization .  \n \nDuring the pandemic , I feel like most companies had to relax their standards a little bit just to be able to get \nthrough what was such a difficult time.  And probably for us too.  And I think that we've all been fighting the last \ncouple of years to get back to those almost unreasonable standards that we had for several year s. And I would just \nsay we've made a lot of progress , but keep fighting.  That is a fight worth fighting.  \n \nIt is what customers expect from us and it's where they're going to gravitate toward . The companies that keep \nincreasing what's possible for customers  and have those really high expectations deliver best for customers .  \n \n",
  "are-right-a-lot": "Are right, a lot. Leaders are right, a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse \nperspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.  \n \nSo the right a lot leadership principle is very much proxy for judgment.  And the truth is that you can do a lot of \nthings right , but if you make the wrong decisions on really the key questions we have to answer for ourselves \u2014for \ncustomer experience in the business \u2014you're going  have an issue .  \n \nAnd we operate in high areas of ambiguity in many of the  businesses that Amazon pursues.  We're the first market \nor we're inventing in that space . Or even when we built a business that works well, we're constantly trying to \nfigure out how to keep changing and improving the customer experience.  \n \nSo we always deal  in areas that have lots of ambiguity, lots of noise around it.  And we have to be great at this \ncompany at sifting through all the different noise and finding the signal and what really matters for customers.  \n \nAnd I remember when we first put this leadersh ip principle in place, people often got it wrong and what people \nmisinterpreted was they thought, \u201cwell, if I'm really great at the leadership principle of being right a lot , it means \nwhen we're debating something, my idea has to be one, the one that carri es the day because after all, I would be \nright a lot. \u201d \n \nAnd the reality is what we're all trying to do is we're trying to get to the best possible answer for customers, \nwhoever's idea it is.  And so what, what we need to do and we're thinking about a hard i ssue is we need to get the \nright people in a room, the right people to give feedback.  It's often why as leaders, we speak last in the room . We \nwant everybody's input, we want, you know, and a lot of times in those meetings, what a lot of the leaders are \ndoing is they're thinking about what they going in opinion was, and they're seeking to try and find a different way.  \n \nYou know, I'm often question my close , most closely held beliefs on a particular topic to see , are they really  right ? \nIs there another way t o think about it?  Can we do better for customers?  \n \nAnd so the key is to get the right people involved in giving feedback, listen to the different perspectives and then \nthink about what is the best possible answer for customers or for the business . It doesn 't matter if it was your idea \nor not in many of the best meetings I'm in, I never even have to express an opinion.  The team has sorted it out for \nthemselves.  But all we care about as leaders is getting to the best possible answer for customers.  That's our job. \n \n",
  "ownership": "Ownership.  Leaders are owners, they think long term and don't sacrifice long -term value for short -term results.  \nThey act on behalf of the entire company beyond just their own team. They never say \u201cthat's not my job. \u201d \n \nOwnership that leadership principle is a mindset and a way to behave and in many ways, it's the most attitudinal of \nall of these leadership principles.  \n \nYes, it means when you tell your team, you've got something , that you've got it . And that you don't have  to be \nreminded constantly of getting it done.  But it also is a way of thinking about the business and the company  that\u2019s  \nmore holistic and long -term . Great owners are always asking themselves, what would I do if this were my personal \nmoney?   \n \nAnd we used to talk about this anecdot e a lot , which is the difference between renters and owners.  So if you have \nan apartment and it's Christmas time and you buy a Christmas tree, sometimes a renter will actually , amazingly , \nnail the Christmas tree into the wood floo r. You would never do that if you own that apartment and those wood \nfloors . We have to think like owners.  \n \nI was speaking with a young professional , actually just a few weeks ago, and I was asking that person about their \nnew job\u2014they don't work at Amazon \u2014I was asking them about their new job and, and, and the store that they \nwork in.  And, I was asking them if they had any ideas for how they could increase the revenue of the store that \nthey're working in.  And they said, \u201cwell, I'm not really that interested in that, you know, I don't get paid more  if I \ncome up with an idea for more revenue, I don't get a commission on that.  It's not really my area .\u201d And I thought \nthat's not ownership . \n \nBy the way,  this young person will get  this. This  is a really young person . But my point is that's not how we think \nabout ownership.  That's not what we want.  We want people who feel like owners who think about problems more \nholistically . If they see an issue and they don't know if it has an owner to resolve it, they find that ow ner. They  \ndon't just assume that Sarah or John has it.   \n \nIf they see something that looks like it's half -finished or they don't know if there's going to be the right pass off to \nsomebody.  They make sure that there is that pass off and if there isn't, then they take care of it themselves.  \n \nOwners ensure the problems are owned, that they have a path to resolution and they drive it themselves as \nneeded.  And when there's a hard problem, owners don't punt it for somebody else.  Owners figure out how to pull \na gro up of people together to find the right solution for customers.  \n \nThey think about the issues from an entire company perspective and they think about it long term.  That's what we \nwant and owners and that's what we expect.  \n \n",
  "frugality": "Frugality . Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self -sufficiency, and invention. There \nare no extra points for growing head count, budget size, or fixed expense.  \n \nWhen I last did a presentation on leadership principles to a large group of people, it was about four years ago.  And \nwhen I got to this leadership principle, I said frugality is pretty straightforward . And on the face of it, it is pretty \nstraightforward.  \n \nBut as I thought about it over the last four years, we have hired s o many new people who come from so many \ndifferent backgrounds and contexts that I thought it might be useful to just share how we really think about what \nfrugality is.  \n \nThere's a reason that we have door desk s and we have always had door de sks. It's a sign al to ourselves that we \nwant to  be scrappy,  that we don't want extra garnishing,  that we're trying to be as frugal as possible.  \n \nThere's a reason that our former CFO , Mark Peek, famously at an all company meeting said \u201cI'll bend over for a \npenny.\u201d Because when you build a company whose foundation was based on a single digit operating margin retail \nbusiness , basis points matter . All those things matter.  \n \nFor a long time , people thought we had a real business model disadvantage because we had this retail busi ness \nthat was a high volume, relatively low margin business.  In fact, some people may still think we have that \ndisadvantage.  \n \nI think it's an advantage for all sorts of reasons, but especially because constraints breed resourcefulness and \ninvention that ha s always been true . And it also breeds being great operators of high volume, low margin \nbusinesses, which very few companies are particularly very few technical companies.  \n \nI saw this frugality come into play many times.  You know, if I go back to when we w ere starting AWS , people forget \nwe built S3, which is our simple storage service and EC2, which is our elastic compute cloud , with  13-person team s. \n13-person team s, those were both built.  \n \nAnd I remember in the early days, people would say to us, \u201cwell, this is not reasonable to expect to build \nsomething great with 13 -person teams.  I'm competing against companies who have teams 10 times the size of this \nteam.\u201d \n \nAnd of course, those teams built amazing, pioneering, still leading products because they had to  be inventive . You \nknow, constraints breed resourcefulness.  \n \nI also remember as we were scaling out AWS , which is a huge logistical business that the fact that we had so many \npeople who grew up in our retail business, which is a very strong operating high volume, relatively low margin \nbusiness.  We were much better at operating that type of business and finding ways to be more cost effective for \ncustomers than other technology companies.  \n \nWhen you save money on everything you do, it means you can invest more  in giving customers lower prices and \ngiving them more capabilities.  \n \nNow this all seems, I think,  fairly logical, particularly if you've lived in this culture for a long time.  But what's \ninteresting is over the last several years as Amazon has become a mu ch larger company.  I mean, we're a company \nthat has 500 billion  dollars  plus of revenue.  The numbers get so large that people almost get numb to some of \nthese numbers.  \n \nI mean, I remember when I had to ask for 50 people or a million dollars, it felt like s o much money.  And now I hear \nsometimes people saying things like, \u201cwell, I don't know, it's only $100 million .\u201d Or, \u201cyou know, to start this idea.  \nYou know, I only need 65 -70 people .\u201d  \n \nDon't get numb to those numbers.  Our very best people, our very best t eams, our very best businesses do more \nwith less.  \n \nAnd if you work in a business that has more generous margins than our retail business,  don't spend more just \nbecause you have margins to support it . Be frugal every bit you can save on, you can give back to customers in the \nform of lower prices and more capabilities.  \n \nAnd I would also say, don't believe that the best way to build your career and to develop your career is to have \nlarge teams.  That is not the case .  \n \nWe want and value people who build amazin g customer experiences and amazing businesses as leanly as possible.  \nThat's how we think about great people.  That's how we're going to  think about it in our promotion process.  And \nthat's the way we want to  operate together . \n \n \n"
